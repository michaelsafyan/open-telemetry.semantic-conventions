# Semantic conventions for Google Generative AI operations

**Status**: [Development][DocumentStatus]

The Semantic Conventions for [Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs) and [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) extend and override the [GenAI Semantic Conventions](README.md).

## Spans

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

Semantic Conventions for model inference spans when calling Google systems.

`gen_ai.system` MUST be set to `"gcp.gen_ai"`, `"gcp.vertex_ai"`, or `"gcp.gemini"`.

**Span kind** SHOULD be `CLIENT`.

**Span status** SHOULD follow the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md) document.

**[1] `gen_ai.operation.name`:** If one of the predefined values applies, but specific system uses a different name it's RECOMMENDED to document it in the semantic conventions for specific GenAI system and use system-specific name in the instrumentation. If a different name is not documented, instrumentation libraries SHOULD use applicable predefined value.

**[2] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD match the error code returned by the Generative AI provider or the client library,
the canonical name of exception that occurred, or another low-cardinality error identifier.
Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

**[3] `gcp.client.service`:** Intended to be a stable identifier for Google Cloud client libraries that is uniform across implementation languages. The value should be derived from the canonical service domain for the service; for example, 'foo.googleapis.com' should result in a value of 'foo'.

**[4] `gen_ai.conversation.id`:** Instrumentations SHOULD populate conversation id when they have it readily available
for a given operation, for example:

-  when client framework being instrumented manages conversation history
(see [LlamaIndex chat store](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/storing/chat_stores/))

- when instrumenting GenAI client libraries that maintain conversation on the backend side
(see [AWS Bedrock agent sessions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-session-state.html),
[OpenAI Assistant threads](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/threads))

Application developers that manage conversation history MAY add conversation id to GenAI and other
spans or logs using custom span or log record processors or hooks provided by instrumentation
libraries.

**[5] `gen_ai.output.type`:** This attribute SHOULD be used when the client requests output of a specific type. The model may return zero or more outputs of this type.
This attribute specifies the output modality and not the actual output format. For example, if an image is requested, the actual output could be a URL pointing to an image file.
Additional output format details may be recorded in the future in the `gen_ai.output.{type}.*` attributes.

**[6] `gen_ai.output.type`:** when applicable and if the request includes an output format.

**[7] `gen_ai.request.model`:** The name of the GenAI model a request is being made to. If the model is supplied by a vendor, then the value must be the exact name of the model requested. If the model is a fine-tuned custom model, the value should have a more specific name than the base model that's been fine-tuned.

**[8] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[9] `gen_ai.response.model`:** If available. The name of the GenAI model that provided the response. If the model is supplied by a vendor, then the value must be the exact name of the model actually used. If the model is a fine-tuned custom model, the value should have a more specific name than the base model that's been fine-tuned.

**[10] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[11] `gcp.gen_ai.operation.config`:** The data structure is dependent on the value of "gen_ai.operation.name" and should correspond with the "*Config" data structure in the Google Gen AI SDK. The Google Gen AI SDK provides these "*Config" data structures in multiple languages, generated from a common source of truth. See "google.genai.types.*" in <https://github.com/googleapis/python-genai> and  `com.google.genai.types.*` in <https://github.com/googleapis/java-genai> for examples.
The JSON dictionary SHOULD include only an allowlisted subset of the request configuration. The contents also SHOULD NOT overlap with configuration that has already been captured elsewhere through standard Semantic Conventions.
Because the data structure is encoded in JSON format, the key names should be specified using "camelCase". More generally, the names should align with the expectations of proto3 JSON encoding <https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/proto3/#json>; for example, fields that represent a timestamp in the local language should get mapped to the proto3 JSON encoding of "google.protobuf.Timestamp" (i.e. RFC 3339 date format) per the specification given in <https://protobuf.dev/reference/protobuf/google.protobuf/#timestamp>. 
Instrumentations SHOULD NOT populate this attribute by default. Rather, instrumentations SHOULD provide an opt-in mechanism through which the config information can be dumped into this field as a tool for debugging and as an escape hatch for the subset of configuration that is not yet representable using standardized conventions.
