      brief: The repository associated with the InstrumentationScope.

      brief: The build target associated with the InstrumentationScope.
      examples: ['//in/bazel/path/to/my/folder:target', 'inGradleYourLib']
      note: >
        Particularly useful if the InstrumentationScope library cannot be
        triangulated from the name and `instrumenation.source.repo` alone.
        If multiple build targets produce the same result, choose the
        narrowest possible target (e.g. for Make: "mylib" rather than "all";
        for Bazel: "//path/to/specific:target", not "//path/..."; etc.).
