      The `gcp.client` conventions are intended to be used by Google Cloud
      client libraries (e.g. https://github.com/googleapis/* and other
      Google-owned/Google-provided client libraries for Google Cloud) to
      identify such clients and to track their operations and performance.

          Short name of the GCP service for which the library is a client.
          All variants of the client across programming languages should use an
          identical value for this property. The short name should be intuitive
          and aligned with either the name of the client (e.g. X for client
          library packages named `google-cloud-X`) or the name of the API
          subdomain (e.g. X for APIs hosted at `X.googleapis.com`).

          Identifies the repository where the client library source comes from.
          The prefix `github.com/` should be not be included in the name. If 
          (`gcp.client.service`, `telemetry.sdk.language`) do not uniquely
          identify the client such as when multiple client variants exist
          for the same service in a given programming language, this field
          should be supplied in order to disambiguate between clients.

          Identifies the build target or deployment artifact within the
          repository. In cases where multiple variants of the client exist
          within the same repository, `gcp.client.repo` may not be sufficient
          to disambiguate between client variants. For those cases, this
          attribute may be used as an alternative approach to disambiguation.
